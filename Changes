(Recent) Revision history for Perl extension Data-Dumper-Interp

7.012 - Show names of subs pointed to by CODE refs (using Sub::Identify)
7.011 - Require bigrat 0.65 (per rt 145960). Update shared test library.
        Avoid defeating Data::Dumper's special handling of booleans (!!0 etc.)
7.010 - Revise Objects() sub-options to allow better control of how
        overloaded operators are handled in displayed objects.
        Updated shared test libraries.  Fixed support for older Perls.
7.009 - Generalized Useqq="style=BEFORE,AFTER" in lieu of "qq=BA"
7.008 - Diagnose invalid method modifier when imported, not when 1st called
      - Test messages to try to diagnose mystery test failure only on Windows
      - Generate META.json
7.00? - Remove multiple "use 5.xxx" which is deprecated in Perl 5.39.8
7.005 - Windows portability; Rm multiple use VERSION (deprecated in perl 5.9)
7.004 - 'd' method modifier ("debug friendly") enables 'condense' and, if
        STDOUT is a utf-encoding handle, 'spacedots'.  Always used by dvis.
7.003 - Fix bug where $. was not preserved on first call (termwidth detection)
7.002 - Use wide chars only with Useqq("unicode") and utf STDOUT or ERR.
        'l' method modifier omits quotes in vis() string result.
        Useqq("underscores") separates digits of large numbers.
        Useqq("hex") shows numbers in hexadecimal
        Useqq("octets") optimizes string display for binary data, e.g.
          show octal escapes and not \n \r etc.
7.001 - dvis (and any with Useqq(...:condense) show replicated chars compactly
6.011 - Silence 'stty' message if no terminal width is available
6.010 - trying to find mystery test failure on one Windows smoker host
6.009 - Fix result-parsing bug with Deparse(1).
        Show (classname) before [] and {} from overloaded operators.
        Updated cmd.com support in qsh(), and allow $^O to be localized
6.008 - Recursively visit overload results.
6.007 - Require List::Util v1.45 for uniqstr.
        Croak if vis, etc. called in void context (typically a missing "say ").
        Fix bug where ivis & dvis would not interpolate \$ -> $
6.006 - Carp but don't die if invalid $varname is in ivis/divs string
6.005 - Avoid addrvis on temp container for avis/hvis - for test stability
6.004 - Fix bug Maxdepth off-by-1 with Refaddr. Renamed
        set_addrvis_digits -> addrvis_digits, which now gets with undef arg
6.003 - Fixed bug where AUTOLOAD did not preserve $@ etc.
6.001 - Added set_addrvis_digits() & addrvis_forget()

6.000 - 1. Option Refaddr() added to show abbreviated ref addresses.

        2. Shortcut function/method names can now include 'r' to imply
           Refaddr(1) and any number to imply Maxdepth(number).

        3. Shortcut functions/methods are now auto-generated using a naming
           convention: "Modifier" characters are glued onto one of the 5 basic
           method names (ivis, dvis, vis, avis, or hvis) in any order
           with optional underscore separators.  For example using 'viso'
           or 'ovis' or 'vis_o' will generate code to call 'vis' with
           option Objects(0) to show object internals.  Another example is
           dvisr3, dvis3r, dvis_r_3, etc. which calls 'dvis' configured to
           show the abbreviated addresses of any refs in interpolated
           variables, and to show at most 3 levels of structured data.

           This eliminates memory bloat rarely unused subs.  In fact,
           a fixed repertoire of variations is no longer really feasible.

           Methods are created when first called using the AUTOLOAD mechanism.

           import() generates stub declarations for imported functions so
           that prototypes are properly checked; the bodies are generated only
           if/when actually called.

        4. The names 'alvis' and 'hlvis' are deprecated but still supported
           as special cases.  Please use avisl, etc. instead (i.e. place
           the modifier 'l' before or after the basic method name).

5.029 - Implement ravis,ravisq,rhvis,rhvisq which prefix object and
        non-blessed container contents with type<abbrevatedaddress>
        ala addrvis().

5.025 - qsh() now quotes for cmd.com on windows (instead of /bin/sh)
